          <p>This website was made with 3 programming languages!<br>
          1. HTML: For making the texts and links.<br>
          2. CSS: For designing the html elements and putting some effects.<br>
          3. PHP: For making the "head" of the website work.</p>

          <p>Yes!<br>
          This website gets updated every 1-2 weeks(if needed)<br>
          You can suggest whatever to put on the website to make it better,by sending me an E-Mail: <a href = "https://www.google.com/intl/el/gmail/about/#" target = "_blank">alenandreasianyt@gmail.com</a></p>

          and he is happy and proud of himself for making a website by himself!</p>
